# Nabla JS SDK

The [Nabla](https://www.nabla.com/) JS SDK makes it quick and easy to build an excellent healthcare communication experience in your web app.

## ⚠️ End of support

We took the decision to discontinue the Nabla Care Platform and with that stop maintaining the Nabla JS SDK.

The Nabla Care Platform will remain operational until September 30th, 2024, but we would greatly appreciate it if you could transition before that date. We are committed to ensuring a seamless transition and are here to assist you in any way you need. You can fork this SDK repository if you want to modify it or reuse it with a different backend.

## Documentation

Check our [documentation portal](https://docs.nabla.com/docs/concepts-js) for in depth documentation about integrating the SDK.

Install the SDK by running:

```sh
yarn add @nabla/js
```

or

```sh
npm install --save @nabla/js
```

You can find the latest version available in the [release page](https://github.com/nabla/nabla-js/releases).
