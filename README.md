# Nabla JS SDK

The [Nabla](https://www.nabla.com/) JS SDK makes it quick and easy to build an excellent healthcare communication experience in your web app.

Right now the library is in alpha, meaning all core features are here and ready to be used but API might change during the journey to a stable 1.0 version.

## Documentation

Check our [documentation portal](https://docs.nabla.com/docs/concepts-js) for in depth documentation about integrating the SDK.

Install the SDK by running:

```sh
yarn add @nabla/js
```

or

```sh
npm install --save @nabla/js
```

You can find the latest version available in the [release page](https://github.com/nabla/nabla-js/releases).
